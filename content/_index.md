# Welcome to Tiny Toolkits

Hello, we're fans of tools and tiny toolkits. This is a curated library of some of the
[toolkits](https://tinytoolk.it/toolkits/) and [tools](https://tinytoolk.it/tools/) we own, use, or have seen.

Please have a look around and check out [The Tiny Toolkit Manifesto](https://tinytoolk.it/manifesto/).

If you want to share images and/or a writeup of your own Tiny Toolkit, consider sending in a pull request to our [github repository](https://github.com/tinytoolkit/tinytoolk.it).
