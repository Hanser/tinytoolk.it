The Openterface Mini-KVM is an open source hardware gadget that allows you to use a laptop or any
other computer as a virtual screen, keyboard, and mouse for any HDMI-and-USB-touting device. If you find yourself frequently debugging or setup SBCs, servers or any other computer-y device, then I think you'll find this very appealing.

In datacenters and the like you'd often see a monitor, mouse and keyboard on wheels (a "crash cart") and it's cool that this totally replaces that using the laptop you'd already have with you!

I found a [link to the Crowdsupply][cs] somewhere on Fedi a while back, and got shipped the
unit in late 2024. It works great! It also has programmable pins and a USB type A port
that's switchable between the Host and Target devices with is a really nice touch.
