I found that I was frequently picking up my full size ratchet screwdriver and taking it along with my tiny tool kit, a clue that there was a gap in my tool kit. So I added the smallest and sweetest ratchet screwdriver I could find, the Wera 838 RA S.

It has a very smooth ratchet mechanism and a neat trick where you can turn the ratchet with your fingers to micro adjust a screw.

[Will Roberson on Youtube likes the click of the Wera 838 RA S ratchet too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBUezxzeRw4).


It really is tiny.
