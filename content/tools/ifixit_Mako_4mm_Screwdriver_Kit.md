The iFixit Mako is an excellent quality set of precision screwdrivers with 64 4mm bits in a box. Mine lives on my desk and gets used almost every day. 

For a portable tiny tool kit I needed something ultra compact. So I kept the Mako driver, and just the 35 bits I use all the time.

The bits are stored in 2 [custom 3d printed TPU holders](https://www.printables.com/model/700125-4mm-screwdriver-bit-holders).

The remaining 29 bits, which only get used rarely, have been stored in a compact 2 row holder ([also custom 3D printed](https://www.printables.com/model/700886-compact-bit-holder-for-30-4mm-screwdriver-bits)), which generally stays at home, unless I am exprecting some product dissassembly.
