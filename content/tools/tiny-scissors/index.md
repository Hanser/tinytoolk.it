# Fiskars 4" folding scissors 

[195160-1012](https://www.fiskars.com/en-us/crafting-and-sewing/products/scissors-and-shears/folding-scissors-4-195160-1012)

OK little scissors. They do fold up nice and small, but they feel a tiny bit rickety in use.

Surprisingly decent scissors for paper and card in a pen-sized package.
