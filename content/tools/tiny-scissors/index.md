# Fiskars 4" folding scissors 

[195160-1012](https://www.fiskars.com/en-us/crafting-and-sewing/products/scissors-and-shears/folding-scissors-4-195160-1012)

OK little scissors for paper, card, cloth. They do fold up nice and small, but they feel a tiny bit rickety in use.

# CK Electrician's Scissors

[(from Prime Tools)](https://www.primetools.co.uk/product/ck-492001-heavy-duty-electricians-scissors-140mm-soft-cable-tape-ties/)

These are great, very sturdy and very nicely made. They'll cut anything from tissue paper to tin cans, cut and strip massive cables, and they even have hollow ground blades and an adjustable pivot. Perfect for trimming cable ties.
