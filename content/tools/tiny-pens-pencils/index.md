# Zebra TS3 mechanical pencil

A tiny but decent little mechanical pencil. I've taken the clip off this one.

Also worth looking at the Pilot Birdie, which I think is a tiny bit longer. That comes in pen or pencil or a remarkable double-ended pen and pencil.

# Zebra SL-F1 Mini Ballpoint Pen

It's a telescoping ballpoint pen. What more could you want? Retracted it's 84mm, expanded 108mm. This lets it rest naturally in your hand when writing - it feels like a normal pen.

It has a really neat mechanism that covers the nib and retracts up into the body when
extended. It's very fun to play with.

## What it fits in
Notably, a business card box!

## Where to buy
Upsettingly it looks like this specific version of the pen is out of stock everywhere -
you can readily get a slightly bigger variant (just "SL-F1" or "Expandz" rather than
"SL-F1 mini") though. This is a tad larger at 105mm retracted and 134mm expanded.
