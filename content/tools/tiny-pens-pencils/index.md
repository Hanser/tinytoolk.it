# Zebra TS3 mechanical pencil

A tiny but decent little mechanical pencil. I've taken the clip off this one.

Other tiny pens & pencils that are worth a look:
- [Pilot Birdie pencil](https://www.discovery-japan.me/category/select/pid/51110/language/en/currency/JPY) - seems hard to find in Europe?
- [Pilot Birdie Twin](https://www.pilotpen.eu/en/collections/product-categories/birdie-twin-mechanical-pencil-0-5-mm.html) - a tiny pen and pencil in one package
- [OHTO Minimo pen](https://cultpens.com/products/ohto-minimo-ballpoint-pen) - even thinner, I don't find it easy to write with
- [OHTO Minimo pencil](https://cultpens.com/products/ohto-minimo-mechanical-pencil) - ditto
- Victorinox make a [tiny 1.2mm clutch pencil](https://www.swissworld.it/en/victorinox-spare-mini-pencil.html) which may be your only option if you want to fit into an Altoids tin
- and of course the [tiny pen that goes in a Swiss Army Knife](https://www.knivesandtools.co.uk/en/pt/-victorinox-a-3644-pen-large.htm) - annoying to write with but very tiny




# Zebra SL-F1 Mini Ballpoint Pen

It's a telescoping ballpoint pen. What more could you want? Retracted it's 84mm, expanded 108mm. This lets it rest naturally in your hand when writing - it feels like a normal pen.

It has a really neat mechanism that covers the nib and retracts up into the body when
extended. It's very fun to play with.

## What it fits in
Notably, a business card box!

## Where to buy
Upsettingly it looks like this specific version of the pen is out of stock everywhere -
you can readily get a slightly bigger variant (just "SL-F1" or "Expandz" rather than
"SL-F1 mini") though. This is a tad larger at 105mm retracted and 134mm expanded.
