# Zebra TS3 mechanical pencil

A tiny but decent little mechanical pencil. I've taken the clip off this one.

Other tiny pens & pencils that are worth a look:
- [Pilot Birdie pencil](https://www.discovery-japan.me/category/select/pid/51110/language/en/currency/JPY) - seems hard to find in Europe?
- [Pilot Birdie Twin](https://www.pilotpen.eu/en/collections/product-categories/birdie-twin-mechanical-pencil-0-5-mm.html) - a tiny pen and pencil in one package, this is really a remarkable thing.
- [OHTO Minimo pen](https://cultpens.com/products/ohto-minimo-ballpoint-pen) - even thinner, I don't find it easy to write with
- [OHTO Minimo pencil](https://cultpens.com/products/ohto-minimo-mechanical-pencil) - ditto
- Victorinox make a [tiny 1.2mm clutch pencil](https://www.swissworld.it/en/victorinox-spare-mini-pencil.html) which may be your only option if you want to fit into an Altoids tin
- and of course the [tiny pen that goes in a Swiss Army Knife](https://www.knivesandtools.co.uk/en/pt/-victorinox-a-3644-pen-large.htm) - annoying to write with but very tiny.




# Zebra SL-F1 Mini Ballpoint Pen

It's a telescoping ballpoint pen. What more could you want? Retracted it's 84mm, expanded 108mm. This lets it rest naturally in your hand when writing - it feels like a normal pen.

It has a really neat mechanism that covers the nib and retracts up into the body when
extended. It's very fun to play with.

## What it fits in
Notably, a business card box!

## Where to buy
Upsettingly it looks like this specific version of the pen is out of stock almost everywhere -
you can readily get a slightly bigger variant (just "SL-F1" or "Expandz" rather than
"SL-F1 mini") though. This is a tad larger at 105mm retracted and 134mm expanded. 

You might still be able to find this one on eBay, though.


# Uni-ball Style Fit Multifunction Pen

It's a multicolour pen/pencil - you buy the refills separately, from a very wide range of colours and widths, including mechanical pencils.

I like it for diagrams, which I often sketch in pencil then overwrite in colour.

## Where to buy

[Cult Pens](https://cultpens.com/products/uni-ball-style-fit-customisable-5-colour-multifunction-pen) has quite a range, including 3 and 5 colour versions.

The black one in the image is a Style Fit Meister, and is harder to find. It has an eraser, albeit a tiny one under an easily-lost cap.
I got mine from [Plaza Japan](https://www.plazajapan.com/4902778137345/?setCurrencyId=1&gad_source=1)

# Pentel PH158 Multi-pencil

Mostly used for colour-coding and shading diagrams - 8 decent coloured pencils in one go. Also comes in some variants with magical process-safe colours for various print processes.

# Pentel ZE31 eraser

I like this because it will erase a thin line.

# Crea8 6mm gaffer tape

This is a [nice peelable cotton gaffer tape] (https://cre8tapes.com/product/non-reflective-gaffer-cre8-nrg/) which comes in great colours and various widths, including 6mm. I've printed a tiny spool so I can carry a few meters of it around.
