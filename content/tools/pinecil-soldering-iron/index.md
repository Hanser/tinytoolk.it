[The mighty Pinecil](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/)

A great cheap tiny soldering iron. It'll run off USB-C (if it can give it 20V) or from DC into a barrel jack. I usuually run it from the mains adapter below, but I also have a USB power bank that can run it.

In a [custom 3d printed case by Drew Batchelor](https://drewbatchelor.com/portfolio/pinecil-case/)

With a nice bendy silicone USC-C cable

And a UGREEN CD216 GaN charger, which can do the 20V 3A that will keep the Pinecil happy
