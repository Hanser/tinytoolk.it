**Is it a great tool?**

No! It costs just Â£12 from Aliexpress, it looks like a toy and it feels like a toy.

**Is it ultra portable?**

Hell Yes! This tiny multimeter is a featherweight 80g.

**Is it good enough to earn a place in my tiny toolkit?**

Yes, this multimeter is accurate enough and is often enough to help fix products and debug projects in the field.
The tool at hand is more useful than the tool left at home.

 [Review 1](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/aneng-a3008-(6000-count-ultra-compact-pen-type-dmm)-review-photos-and-teardown/) and [Review 2](https://chinese-electronics-products-tested.blogspot.com/p/aneng-a3008-pen-multimeter-tested.html/)


**Core multimeter functions:**

DC voltage, AC voltage and resistance with auto mode-select and auto-range. 
Occasional use modes:
Diode, Frequency, Capacitance, Temperature, Proximity detection of live wires.
Modes that I will probably never use:
Phase detection and a built in torch.

**Comprimises:**

It has no current measurement.
I do not use it for high voltage work (I doubt that the protection circuits and internal fuse are robust), But that's OK, other than occasionally checking if a 230V wire is live, I don't go near high voltage.

**Alternatives:**

For a few dollars more, the ANENG A3009 has all the same functionallity and it talks! 
or the UNI-T 120C has a similar size and weight in a more conventional rectangular format.
