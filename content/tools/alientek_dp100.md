A tiny bench PSU with USB-C input for power - it'll run off the same USB-C supply as my [Pinecil soldering iron](@/tools/pinecil-soldering-iron/index.md). 
I got this from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006452737051.html) for about £40.

Comes in this nice but huge case:

I will probably use it most with these [Wago 215-211 4mm wire clamp terminals](https://uk.farnell.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=15001)
