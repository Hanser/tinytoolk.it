Aluminium screwtop tins from eBay, https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/324342678225

5ml for tip cleaner, filled with a bit of tip cleaner cut from a conventionally-sized one. You might want to put some big washers (or a couple of 20ps) in the bottom to make it stay on the bench.

10ml for solder, with a 3d printed spool made by pressing these two parts together:
[core](<./solder spool core.stl>)
[end](<./solder spool end.stl>)
