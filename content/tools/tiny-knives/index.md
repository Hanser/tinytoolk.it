# Folding titanium scalpel

Despite its size, actually very usable for fine work. 

Easily found on AliExpress in ever-changing designs from ever-changing vendors. Often made of titanium, as is this one. 

Has a #11 blade, which is a good pointy one for paper and card.

# Swann-Morton Retractaway scalpel

[Scalpels and blades](https://www.scalpelsandblades.co.uk/handle-detail_166_retractaway-premium-knife-swann-morton-product-no-2806-9206-.php)

Solid, metal body and bayonet, very nice to use. This one has a 10A blade in, good for heavier-duty work than the #11

# Stanley 9mm Interlock snap-blade knife

[Part number 0-10-095](https://www.toolstop.co.uk/stanley-0-10-095-9mm-snap-off-blade-knife-p28972)

Snap-blade knives mean you can always get a new point when you need one. They can give you a very long blade, too, for things like foam.

Olfa make [a variety of spare blades for these](https://olfacutters.co.uk/Olfa-spare-blades-Spare-Blades-for-olfa-cutters-knives-RB10-RB18-RB28-RB45-CMP-HOK-MC45-PRB-LB10-COB-SKB-WAB-FWB10-SKB5-SKB7/olfa-9mm-blades)

I like the [Excel Black](https://olfacutters.co.uk/Olfa-spare-blades-Spare-Blades-for-olfa-cutters-knives-RB10-RB18-RB28-RB45-CMP-HOK-MC45-PRB-LB10-COB-SKB-WAB-FWB10-SKB5-SKB7/olfa-9mm-blades/Abb-50B-Olfa-Spare-Blade-ABB-50-9mm-Excel-Black-Blade) ones, because who doesn't want sharper blades ?
