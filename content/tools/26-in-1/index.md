All the bits in one screwdriver! There's room for Pozi, Phillips, Allen, Torx, and slot. Wiha sell this with various selections of bits but none of the selections are ideal, so you might end up mix-and-matching with some of the refill packs.

It is also labelled differently in the EU and the USA. [In UK it was labelled as a Wiha LiftUp 26one 43895](https://wiha.com/int/en/tools/highlights/all-top-sellers/screwdriver-with-bit-magazine-liftup-26one/43895)

The only place I could find to buy the refill packs was [Digikey](https://www.digikey.co.uk/en/products/detail/wiha/77784/11512945) - part codes 77780 to 77784.

Before you get any clever ideas, these bits do not work in most 1/4" hex holders, there isn't enough hex to engage with the holder.
