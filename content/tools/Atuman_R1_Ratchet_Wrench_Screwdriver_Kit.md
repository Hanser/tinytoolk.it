The Duka Atuman R1 Ratchet Wrench Screwdriver set is compact and with it's aluminium body, it's lightweight too. 

It gives a huge amount of functionality in one package, replacing; 
Ratchet, screwdriver, stubby screwdriver and allen keys.

It costs just £12 from Aliexpress.
The trade off's I am balancing, it will not be as durable as some more expensive alternatives - time will tell if it is any good, nor as ergonomic as single use tools. Like every multitool, it does many things, none of them perfectly. This is not one of those tools that will give "that special magic feeling"^tm^ every time you use it.

For a tiny tool kit, I removed the case, and some of the less common bits and designed a 2 row custom 3d printed TPU holder.

For a simmilar higher quality functionality see the Facom r180 compact wrench in Jarkman's Tiny Toolkit 
https://tinytoolk.it/tools/facom-r180/ and some lightweight bike alternatives.
With the 1/4" to 4mm hex adapter in the Mako kit, this can also drives all my 4mm bits.  

Update: 29/4/25 - Not recommended.

The concept is good, it's lightweight, but the quality of materials and construction are not good enough. What did I expect for £12?
After 6 months of light use, the ratchet lever fell out (picture below) and 2 or 3 of the bits have shattered due to poor material quality. I can still push it back in to change direction, so it's still in my kit, until I find a better replacement.
