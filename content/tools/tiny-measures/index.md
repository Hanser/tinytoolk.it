# Fisher 150mm satin chrome rule

A really good little ruler. Flexible, high contrast, markings are very durable. Costs about 3 quid.

This one has been chopped down to fit in the flexure kit.

# Kutsuwa 300mm folding rule

Because who doesn't want a long ruler in a short case ? Also functions as a sort-of set square, with detents at assorted angles.

Midori make something similar, too, in plastic or metal.

# 70mm vernier caliper

A tiny (and not very high quality)(but handy) vernier caliper. The jaws are not actually 100% parallel and the internal jaws are out by a third of a millimeter. I might fix that with a file.
But, they did only cost a tenner from AliExpress. A very similar-looking model is sold by Moore and Wright for 25 quid, and that is probably better made and a better idea.
