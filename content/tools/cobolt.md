These have a lot of cutting power for their size, up to 3.6mm piano wire, and for softer stuff they'll cut anything you can fit in their jaws. 
They come in a [dizzying variety of models](https://www.knipex.com/products/cutting-pliers/knipex-cobolt-compact-bolt-cutters) - mine are the 71 21 200, with an angled head 
for flushier cutting and 200mm handles, but there are variants with shorter and longer handles and with straight heads.
