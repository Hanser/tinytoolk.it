At Paper Club, we make things out of paper. Cut, folded, taped, glued, tiny and large. This is the kit I take.

## Case
Sewn - cotton canvas, a scrap of leather for a cover, #10 zip

## Contents
- [Folding rule](@/tools/tiny-measures/index.md#kutsuwa-300mm-folding-rule)
- [Folding scissors](@/tools/tiny-scissors/index.md)
- [0.5mm mechanical-pencil compass](@/tools/tiny-measures/index.md#sharpest-compass)


- [Retractaway scalpel and spare blade](@/tools/tiny-knives/index.md)
- Cheap circle-cutter. If you want one of these, the [Olfa ones](https://olfacutters.co.uk/index.php?route=product/search&search=compass%20cutter) are better.
- Bone folder (EK tools) (actually melamine, I think)
- Locking forceps
- Assorted pens & pencils
- Tiny aluminium set square

There's usually a glue tape roller in here too, but mine ran out and they seem to be hard to find these days.
