Toolkit that comes in handy when you want to
- connect your laptop to a screen/projector
- have issues with a PC
- want to free a PC from a Windows installation

## Case

- Old camera bag – not ideal, but it was there and for free

## Contents

### Small compartment

- Collection of
    - (mostly low capacity) USB-keys
        - filled with different linux live systems or installers (debian, manjaro, ubuntu)
    - Micro SD-cards
    - SD-/Micro SD-card adapter & USB-reader

### Big compartment
{{ figure(width=640, path="toolkits/hansers_pc_kit/big_compartment.jpg", caption="Contents of big compartment") }}

- Ethernet patch cable (RJ45)
- USB-A to micro USB3 to SATA adapter (5V, thus 2.5" only)
- Wireless USB presenter (uses AAA-battery in the remote)
- HDMI-cable
- Adapter: Mini-DisplayPort to
    - regular DisplayPort
    - HDMI
    - DVI
- Brand new 240 GB SATA SSD
    - in case I want to:
        - upgrade an old PC with HDD – and of course install Linux(!)
        - make some tests

## Side view

And for completeness – to get an understanding of how thick everything is: This is the side view.
