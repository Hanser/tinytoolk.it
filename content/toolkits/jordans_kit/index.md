A tiny toolkit hard-case for building drones, fixing robots, and fiddling with Jet Suits.

This is my everyday toolkit that lives in my backpack. The intention was not to create the most minimal, or all-encompassing toolkit, or to make something perfectly suited to any one specific task. It was made to be a baseline for most jobs or projects, that I can add to with another toolkit or project specific equipment as needed.

## Case

{{ figure(width=640, path="toolkits/jordans_kit/closed.jpg") }}

The [Peli M50](https://peliproducts.co.uk/collections/micro) is a nice (but expensive) choice, being just large enough to fit the Wera Tool-Check in the lid, held in place with some 3D printed blocks. Sitting flush below is a 3D printed divider, separating two sections - one for mostly long skinny things, and another for everything else.

The hard case protects the contents, and a layer of foam keeps things from moving around too much.

The downside of the hard-case (especially when this densely packed) is that things must be relatively well organised to make it close easily.

## To add

- tape, ideally VHB but I haven't found a nice way to store a small amount.
- multimeter, but I can't find one small enough to fit.
- 65W+ USB-C charger (for soldering iron/phone/laptop), it'd take up a lot of room, and I almost certainly already have one with me.
- lighter, mostly for heatshrink (but the stem of the soldering iron does a good enough job).
- digital caliper.
- torch, but I usually have one attached to my backpack.
- soldering tip cleaner - maybe something in a small soldering tin.
- USB-C data cable, but I almost always have one with me anyway.
