A tiny toolkit hard-case for building drones, fixing robots, and fiddling with Jet Suits.

This is my everyday toolkit that lives in my backpack. The intention was to make a baseline toolkit for most jobs or projects, that I can add to with another toolkit or project specific equipment as needed. Rather than to create the most minimal, or all-encompassing toolkit for one specific task.

## Case

{{ figure(width=640, path="toolkits/jordans_kit/closed.jpg") }}

The [Peli M50](https://peliproducts.co.uk/collections/micro) is a nice (but expensive) choice, being just large enough to fit the Wera Tool-Check in the lid, held in place with some 3D printed blocks. Sitting flush below is a 3D printed divider, separating two sections - one for mostly long skinny things, and another for everything else.

The hard case protects the contents, and a layer of foam keeps things from moving around too much.

The downside of the hard-case (especially when this densely packed) is that things must be relatively well organised to allow it close easily.

## To add

Tools and things I am considering adding in the future:

- Tape, ideally VHB but I haven't found a nice way to store a small amount.
- Multimeter, but I can't find one small enough to fit.
- 65W+ USB-C charger (for soldering iron/phone/laptop), it'd take up a lot of room, and I almost certainly already have one with me.
- Lighter, mostly for heatshrink (but the stem of the soldering iron does a good enough job).
- Digital caliper.
- Torch, but I usually have one attached to my backpack.
- Soldering tip cleaner - maybe something in a small soldering tin.
- USB-C data cable, but I almost always have one with me anyway.
