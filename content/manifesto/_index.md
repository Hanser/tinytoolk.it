## Tiny Tool Kit Manifesto Talk at EMF

[Drew](https://drewbatchelor.com/) wrote and presented a talk at [Electromagnetic Field 2024](https://www.emfcamp.org/) about the joy of tiny tool kits, introducing the Tiny Toolkit Manifesto and this website.

When the video of that talk is live, we will add it here. In the meantime, here are the slides from the talk, and here is [the spreadsheet]("manifesto/TinyToolkit.xlsx") mentioned in the talk which is a reasonable aproximation of Drew's product engineering and repair kit.
