## Why do we love these tiny tools so much ?

It's an excellent question. And I'm not sure the answer is simple, but here are some parts of it:
- We love tools that do a lot with a little. Economy, efficiency, that kind of thing.
- We love the feeling of packaged capability that comes with a good kit - all the things you need and nothing else
- Sometimes we really do need to fix robots in fields (or cafes or churches) and you have to have the right tools with you to get that done.
- And maybe we just love tools, too. Especially the good stuff.

## Is this the same as EDC ?

Because there are a *lot* of EDC videos out there, and there's obviously some kind of overlap. 

But there are some differences, too. These are not tools to take with you everywhere you go, these are kits for specific purposes. 
They have history, with years of opinionated adding and removing of tools.

That means there are a lot more relevant tools. Plus it doesn't all have to fit in your trouser pockets. Which is good, because it doesn't.

## Why did we make a website about them ? 

Because we're all interested, especially in the ones which have taken some tiem and trouble to find, and we think other people might be too.

## Which is the best one ? 

They're all good. Depends what you need to do.
